   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

### Installing Dependencies
After cloning the repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Navigate into the cloned repositoryâ€™s directory:
   ```
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_name>` with the name of your cloned repository.

2. Install the dependencies:

# Geometrical Points Creation

This project is about creating geometrical points based on selected locations. The process is divided into three main steps:

## 1. Creating Geometrical Points

This is the first step where you will select locations and generate geometrical points. There are three types of geometrical points that you can create:

- **Point**: This allows you to generate one or more points for each location.
- **LineString**: This allows you to generate one or more line strings. Each line string is composed of multiple points.
- **Polygon**: This allows you to generate a polygon. A polygon is an area that is enclosed by a border.

## 2. Naming and Dating Locations

In this step, you will assign names to the chosen locations. You will also record the date of creation for each location.

## 3. Sending Data to Database

In this last step, you'll send the coordinates details and their names and creation dates, to a database. After you submit, you should see a success message on your screen.
